				<div class = "Intro"><a name = "Intro"><p>Michael:</p><p> As you know, I have been trying to learn code. One day as I was talking to my friend Marilyn, I mentioned I'm terrible with giving gifts and you didn't want me to spend more money on you. She decided to help me learn how to code a cute Valentine's day website for you and here we are. I wrote all the code myself (with a little help) so I know it's really amateur and not styleish but hey, I tried. I hope you enjoy!</p></a></div>
